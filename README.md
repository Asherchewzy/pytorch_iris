# Pytorch GPU Implementation
## Demo of pytorch neural network classification on classical data set iris using local GPU
- The iris dataset is a classical dataset used in learning machine learning and deep learning. 
- The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Contents
In this repo, I demostrate how to use a local gpu to run a neural network in pytorch to classify the Iris species. 
Codes also include how the model can be saved to be used to predict and unseen data. 
- Running Pytorch on a small local GPU
- Training a neural network
- Saving model and using saved model
